If something goes awry with our plant or if you have any other questions about the project, please contact one of them! Our goal is to create this website to accompany a plant that is able to be watered remotely by anyone. Hallmark features of this project include a Raspberry Pi 5 for hardware/watering purposes, and Azure Pipelines for deployment.</p>
